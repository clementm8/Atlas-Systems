Project Description:
A native IOS app built using Median.co to allow users access and monitor their home security system securely.


Project Requirements:
- IOS native
- Push notifications: Live updates on events such as motion detected at home, alarm activated, and software update required
- Biometric Authentication: Using FaceId/Touch id to login to the app
- DataStore: Store user profile information and activity log locally


Technical Implementation:

The native app:
- Uses Median Bridge via the Median Js library to access median.* methods for plugin functionality. 
- The bridge is an API that the WebApp/Website uses to control the native app. 
- Alternatively we could use the median protocol to access the bridge but it doesnt fit our usecase and its not the recommended approach:
The median protocol is good for simple one way communication on the bridge, not back and forth where responses are needed


----Features

Biometric Authentication using Touch ID/FaceID:
- The Median Face ID / Touch ID plugin uses the Median JavaScript Bridge to securely store and retrieve user credentials.
- The Median plugin uses the app's private Keychain, which:
Is isolated to your app
Requires Face ID/Touch ID to access
Doesn't sync to iCloud Keychain
Isn't visible in Settings → Passwords
- The plugin communicates between the web page and the native app by opening a specific URL with query parameters. Responses from the native app are returned via a callback function in the JavaScript context.
- When a user creates an account, a secret(login credentials) is stored in the IOS keychain which can only be accessed through using a biomertic scan of the face or fingerprint
- The next time the user tries to login to their account, they will have the option to login with face id/touch id

Data store:
- The Native Datastore Plugin lets us to persist/store key-value data such as user preferences and app settings directly on the user's device or in the cloud via the Median JavaScript Bridge.
- It supports both App Storage and Cloud Storage
- For this app we're storing the user's name, address, and activity log in the data store and displaying them in the areas of the UI

What you would improve or add with more time?
- Geo fencing- Auto arm system when leaving home
- Real-time push notifications for key events from the system such as 'Motion Detected', 'Alarm Activated' using One signal or Firebase loud messaging


How you’d explain this implementation to a customer
- The native app and webapp are from the same codebase, making it fster to develop than a native app and effecient to manage
- This app extends the functionality of the product, improving security and accessibility through using biometric data to login and using the Datastore to keep sensitive data on the user's device



Issues I ran into:

How to determine if a device is using Face or Touch id so i can display the right option in the UI flow?
- The MJB has a javascript function to check for any biometric authentication thats available median.auth.status({'callbackFunction': CALLBACK});

The app will execute CALLBACK with an object parameter containing the fields:

hasTouchId: true or false. Indicates if the device is running iOS 9+ and there are fingerprints enrolled, or FaceID is enabled.
biometryType: ‘touchId’, ‘faceId’, or ‘none’. This field is populated on iOS only to differentiate between TouchID and FaceID.
hasSecret: true or false



Apple Developer account required for push notification plugin, relies on APN's (Apple Push Notification service) an needs APN key

How it works:

Your app's server sends a notification to Apple's APN servers
APN routes the notification to the correct user's device
The device displays the notification to the user


Better approach to debugging, i dont have a lot of experience with Native app development or X code so i wasnt sure on how to test in the console log and check for errors
I had to pish code to build on my ios device to test functionality since I knew what the final product should look like, i'm curious to see what tools and process you use in your workflow
It was interesting stepping outside of my comfort zone while also being resourceful and using my existing knowledge on building on the web
