1. The app you built and why you chose the website

Customer profile:
- Atlas Systems, webapp for managing a home security system
- https://atlas-systems.vercel.app/

Why I chose this site
- I chose this site because it had a really strong use case for the plugins i want to implementation
- For a home security monitoring system, Biometric Authentiation and Local Data Store are features that will make the native app more secure and accessible than the web app

How you set up the app in Median App Studio
- Configured the User Interface/Look of the app in the first four sections. So think of app icon, theme, and accessibility
- Configured functionality in last four sections


The plugin you selected and how it works
- Biometric auth
       - How it works?
              When a user creates an account, their username and password is stored in the app. When they try to login, the app checks if the biometric information is available and if it is the user can use it access the secret that was saved and login to their account
              The plugin uses the Median JavaScript Bridge to securely store and retrieve the secret.
       - Why? 
              Security- Instead of username and password, users use a scan of their Face/Fingerprint 
              User experience: Login is 85% faster and more secure
              Median does not store this secret on our end, it stays on the users device

- Barcode code Scanner:
       - This uses the device's camera to scan the barcode for device activation

       Why?
       - Better user experience as current setup used a 12 digit code- reduces user error, 3 to 5 times faster onboarding, more accessible for users with visibility issues
       - Works with existing infrastructure since current products already have barcodes

All plugins use the Median Bridge via the Median Js library to access median.* methods for plugin functionality. 
- The bridge is an API that the WebApp/Website uses to control the native app. 

Any technical constraints or tradeoffs you encountered


What you would improve or add with more time
- Geo fencing(Background Location PLugin)- Auto activate devices when leaving home
- Real-time push notifications(OneSignal)- for key events from the system such as 'Motion Detected', 'Alarm Activated' using One signal or Firebase loud messaging


How you’d explain this implementation to a customer

Why Native with Median?

Security and Privacy
- Your app and user data is not saved on our servers, everything goes straight from your website to the app

Accessibility and User Experience
- Atlas Systems lives on the users device instead of on a browser, bringing your product closer to your users and giving them faster access to their data online or offline
- The content in the native app are from the website, so its always up to date and easy to manage, when you update your site, the app updates automatically.

Issues I ran into:

Debugging Complexity
Challenge: Can't debug native plugin behavior such as FaceID and Scanner in browser dev tools, lack of Native app development or X code experience to check for errors
Tradeoff: Harder to troubleshoot issues compared to pure web development

How I handled it:
- Test on actual device (not just simulator)
- Knowing what the final result should look like
- I'm curious to see what tools and process you use in your workflow
- It was interesting stepping outside of my comfort zone while also being resourceful and using my existing knowledge on building on the web
