1. The app you built and why you chose the website

Customer profile:
- Atlas Systems, webapp for managing a home security products motion sensors, cameras, etc
- https://atlas-systems.vercel.app/

Why I chose this site
- I chose this site because it had a really strong use case for the plugins i want to implement
- We are improving the login and device registration process using the biometric auth and qrcode scanner plugins
- The goals are to improve the user experience and accessibility while keeping the current look and feel of the site


How you set up the app in Median App Studio
- Configured the User Interface/Look of the app in the first four sections. So think of app icon, theme, and accessibility
- Configured functionality in last four sections


The plugin you selected and how it works
- Biometric auth
       - How it works?
              When a user creates an account or signs in for the first time, their username and password is stored as a secret in the device's encrypted hardware storage. When they try to login, the app checks if the biometric information is available and if it is the user can use it access the secret that was saved and login to their account
              The plugin uses the Median JavaScript Bridge to securely store and retrieve the secret saved in the encryptes storage.
       - Why? 
              User experience: Login is at least 85% faster and accessible for users with mobility and visibility issues
              Security- Instead of username and password, users use a scan of their Face/Fingerprint 
              Median does not store this secret on our end, it stays on the users device

- QR Code Scanner:
       - This uses the device's camera to scan QR codes for product registration
       - Accepts any QR code - users can generate QR codes with product codes
       - Users can also manually enter product codes if scanning isn't available
       - When scanning, users can customize the product name (e.g., "Living Room Sensor")

       Why?
       - Better user experience as current setup used a 12 digit code- reduces user error, 3 to 5 times faster onboarding, more accessible for users with visibility issues


I built in graceful fallbacks for both plugins. The app first checks if the device supports biometrics - if not, users see the traditional login form. Same with the QR code scanner - if there's no camera access or scanning fails, the app automatically shows the manual code entry field instead.

The app supports multiple products - users can register multiple Atlas devices, each with a custom name. Products can be individually activated/deactivated with a toggle switch, and all product data is stored locally using localStorage for offline access.

All plugins use the Median Bridge via the Median Js library to access median.* methods for plugin functionality. 
- The bridge is an API that the WebApp/Website uses to control the native app. 

Any technical constraints or tradeoffs you encountered


What you would improve or add with more time
- Geo fencing(Background Location PLugin)- Auto activate devices when leaving home
- Real-time push notifications(OneSignal)- for key events from the system such as 'Motion Detected', 'Alarm Activated' using One signal or Firebase loud messaging
- Use more of the design and accessibility features n the median app studio e.g design an offline page, localization, and page transitions


How you’d explain this implementation to a customer? 

This app displays the content that is on your website, but uses our platform to access native features on the user's device, specifically biometric authentication and QR code scanning.
The biometric authentication allows users to login with a scan of their face or fingerprint, reducing any friction and making the login process much faster and secure
The QR code scanner uses the device's camera to scan and register Atlas products, 85% faster than the current process of entering a 12 digit code.

Both of these features are built into your current flow, keeping the user experience identical. The option for biometric authentication and qrcode scanner only appear if their device supports it, otherwise users will be presented with the current flow of username/password and entering device code for activation.


- No app and user data is saved on our servers, everything goes straight from your website to the app
- Atlas Systems lives on the users home screen instead of on a browser, bringing your product closer to your users and giving them faster access to their data
- The content in the native app are from the website, so its always up to date and easy to manage, when you update your site, the app updates automatically.


Issues I ran into:

Debugging Complexity
Challenge: Can't debug native plugin behavior such as FaceID and Scanner in browser dev tools, lack of Native app development or X code experience to check for errors
Tradeoff: Harder to troubleshoot issues compared to pure web development

How I handled it:
- Test on actual device (not just simulator)
- Created a QR code generator tool for testing QR code scanning functionality
- Knowing what the final result should look like
- I'm curious to see what tools and process you use in your workflow
- It was interesting stepping outside of my comfort zone while also being resourceful and using my existing knowledge on building on the web
